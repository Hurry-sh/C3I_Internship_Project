CMI - Detect Behavior with Sensor Data (CMI_FINAL contains the final implementation)

Body-focused repetitive behaviors (BFRBs), such as hair pulling, skin picking, and nail biting, are self-directed habits involving repetitive actions that, when frequent or intense, can cause physical harm and psychosocial challenges. These behaviors are commonly seen in anxiety disorders and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), thus representing key indicators of mental health challenges.
To investigate BFRBs, the Child Mind Institute has developed a wrist-worn device,Â Helios, designed to detect these behaviors. While many commercially available devices contain Inertial Measurement Units (IMUs) to measure rotation and motion, the Helios watch integrates additional sensors, including 5 thermopiles (for detecting body heat) and 5 time-of-flight sensors (for detecting proximity). See the figure to the right for the placement of these sensors on the Helios device.

GOAL:
To use movement, temperature, and proximity sensor data to differentiate between body-focused repetitive behaviors (BFRBs), like hair pulling, from non-BFRB everyday gestures, like adjusting glasses. The goal of this competition is to develop a predictive model that distinguishes BFRB-like and non-BFRB-like activity using data from a variety of sensors collected via a wrist-worn device. 
Successfully disentangling these behaviors will improve the design and accuracy of wearable BFRB-detection devices, which are relevant to a wide range of mental illnesses, ultimately strengthening the tools available to support their treatment.
